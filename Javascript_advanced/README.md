# JavaScript Advanced

## üìö Overview

This project covers advanced JavaScript concepts that are essential for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Each task demonstrates key mechanisms of how JavaScript works behind the scenes such as scoping, closures, the call stack, binding, and callback handling.

---

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Understand **lexical scoping** and how variable access works in nested functions
- Use and chain **closures** effectively
- Simulate **private methods** using closures
- Understand the **call stack** and execution order
- Use **binding** to fix context issues
- Implement **callbacks** and asynchronous logic with `XMLHttpRequest`
- Dynamically manipulate the **DOM** using JavaScript

## üß™ How to Test

1. Use any modern browser.
2. Open the browser's **developer console**.
3. Copy and paste each `.js` file‚Äôs code into the console.
4. Run the required function calls as described in the comments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Vanilla JavaScript only (No jQuery or frameworks)
- Use `.js` file extension
- Manual QA review must be requested after completion
